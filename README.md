# FSAE Chassis Design and Analysis  

This project focuses on the **design and structural analysis** of a tubular space frame chassis for a Formula SAE (FSAE) race car. The work was carried out as part of the **B.Tech. Project (ME-3082)** during the 6th semester at KIIT.  

## 🚗 Project Overview  
- Designed a new FSAE chassis for the 2023 racing season by iterating on the 2019 competition car.  
- Focused on weight reduction, structural stiffness, safety compliance, and ergonomics.  
- Performed detailed **CAD modeling** and **finite element simulations (ANSYS)** to validate design choices.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Ensure compliance with all FSAE chassis regulations.  
- Reduce chassis weight while maintaining adequate torsional stiffness.  
- Improve driver ergonomics and cockpit safety.  
- Document the design and analysis process for future iterations.  

## 🔧 Methodology  
- **CAD Modeling:** Developed multiple chassis iterations and refined based on analysis results.  
- **Torsional Stiffness Calculation:** Verified structural rigidity using force-displacement analysis.  
- **Impact Analysis:** Conducted **frontal and side impact simulations** with safety factor > 1.5.  
- **Material Selection:** Compared AISI 1018, 1026, and 4130 steels for strength-to-weight optimization.  

## 📊 Results  
- Reduced chassis weight by **~10%** compared to the previous design (from 32.4 kg to 29.1 kg).  
- Achieved torsional stiffness of **~861 Nm/deg**, ensuring sufficient rigidity.  
- Verified compliance with FSAE safety rules for roll hoops, bracing, side impact structure, and cockpit clearance.  
- Achieved center of gravity (COG) height within **250–320 mm**, suitable for a 60° tilt test.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **CAD Software:** SolidWorks / CATIA (for 3D modeling)  
- **Simulation Software:** ANSYS (for FEA and impact analysis)  
- **Programming/Documentation:** MATLAB, MS Office
